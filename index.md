## So I guess I have a webpage now. I am a cool person ðŸ˜Ž

Anyhow, I have nothing to put here but links. If are here it's probably not hard to find my GitHub.
## links
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/sockeye-d)
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fishy)
## Progams I think are cool
- [Obsidian (markdown editor)](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Markdown is kinda cool I guess.
