    godl is another one of those tools born out of frustration of existing solutions.
    I had been using <a href="https://github.com/makovwait/godots">Godots</a>,
    but it didn't automatically store version information in the project, so nothing was portable,
    and it used Godot as the widget toolkit, so it didn't follow the native theme.
    
    To solve this, I learned C++, QML, and the rest of the Qt technologies to make my own project and version manager.
```
godl is a thingy I made too
