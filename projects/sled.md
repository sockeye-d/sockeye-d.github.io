    sled is a <b>s</b>hader <b>l</b>anguage <b>ed</b>itor,
    designed specifically for Minecraft shaderpacks,
    made using in Godot.

    While I still consider it permanently unfinished (who has time for those old projects, am I right), I think it got me curious about IDE and tooling development in general.
    Since then I've created many more tools and various projects to make my (and other developers') lives easier,
    but this one in my mind kicked off the whole thing.

Sled is a thingy I made
